Rice Data Bootcamp Project 2: Texas Workforce Trends

Texas continues to be an economic growth driver for the nation, and as of April 2019 had added 294,200 nonfarm payroll employment positions
over the year before - more than any other state.  Every employment category tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) saw increases
over the prior twelve-month period - with the notable exception of Information category jobs, which were down statewide by 0.7%
(approximately 1,400 positions) over the year before, even as nationwide employment in this field increased.  

Different job categories have led in different regions of our diverse state: Houston’s job growth driven most by mining and manufacturing; 
San Antonio’s by mining and construction; Austin’s by financial services and manufacturing; and Dallas-Fort Worth’s by mining, leisure and 
hospitality, and professional business services. 

This project draws data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), as well as other sources as needed, using Web Scraping to pull data from
BLS on employment by sector in each of Texas’ 25 metropolitan areas as identified by the BLS. The data was then stored on an SQL database
and analyzed using Python, including the Pandas library.

We then used web visualizations to create an interactive dashboard that will allow end users to easily navigate the data, including by one 
clickable maps produced with Leaflet.js. The maps have multiple layers of visualization selectable by the user, 
allowing for robust consideration of each of the major employment categories considered by BLS.

Additionally, the project includes charts created with Plotly.js, D3.js and Chart.js exploring the data in more detail.
